## Here's my take on Fast AI Course
Some of the notebooks are not being rendered on github because of being large
I suggest opening Notebooks on 
  - nbviewer for quick preview.
  - Binder if you wanna play with it

I've worked on self implementation/projects based on the chapters of the book
